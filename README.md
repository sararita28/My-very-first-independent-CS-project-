# My-very-first-independent-CS-project

This is a very unimpressive project but it's the first one I built after having completed my HTML and CSS courses, about 5 months ago. It's extremely inefficient
as I only knew these 2 languages back then. It also took me a lot of time and repetitve work but it's meaningful to me because it opened up my eyes on what one can do with a little CS knowledge. I remember being blown away by the fact that I simply had a vague idea in my mind of what I wanted to accomplish and an empty canvas but that through my "coding" abilities I could take a blank page and turn it into anything I wanted.
